# sqlalchemy-challenge

For this challenge i was tasked with using sqlalchemy to do a climate analysis for an upcoming vacation. I started by using ORM queries, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze and explore the climate data. I then neeede to create a flask api based on the the queries developed prior. For this challenge i referenced w3schools. I will need to go back soon and fix my app.
